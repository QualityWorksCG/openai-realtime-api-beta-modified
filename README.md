# openai-realtime-api-beta-modified

This repository is a modified version of the [OpenAI Realtime API Beta](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-api-beta). The only modification is the addition of an `auth` variable in the `RealtimeClient`, which allows for sending an authentication string (such as a bearer token or API key) in the relay server request.
